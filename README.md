# Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions using Machine Learning
This project tackles credit card fraud detection using machine learning and deep learning, focusing on the challenge of class imbalance in transaction data. It starts with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, including scaling and categorical encoding. To address class imbalance, the study explores oversampling and under sampling techniques. It then evaluates three machine learning and three deep learning models based on precision, recall, and ROC curve metrics. This comparative analysis provides insights into effective methods for fraud detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is: Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection))

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.
This was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format.

This simulated dataset is based on another Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)). The original dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
